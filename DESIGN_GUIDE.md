| **Recommended size** | 500 Ã— 500 px |

## ðŸŽ¨ 2. Design Principles

To maintain consistency with the built-in film covers, please follow these general design rules:

1. **Minimal reinterpretation** â€” inspired by the real packaging, but simplified and unified in style.
2. **Non-commercial intent** â€” all designs are shared for educational and archival use only.


## ðŸ§¾ 3. Metadata (optional but encouraged)

You can include a small `.json` file with each cover to describe the film properties:

```json
{
  "brand": "Kodak",
  "family": "Professional",
  "series": "Portra",
  "iso": 400,
  "class": "135",
  "type": "Color Negative",
  "process": "C-41",
  "designer": "Your Name",
  "notes": "Inspired by ..."
}
