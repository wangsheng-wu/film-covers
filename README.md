# 🎞 Film Covers — Inspired Re-creations for Photon Museum

A curated collection of **film cover designs** recreated with a unified visual language for the **Photon Museum** project. These covers are **inspired by** the classic aesthetics of analog film packaging (Kodak, Fujifilm, etc.) and reinterpreted through a minimal, modern lens for digital archiving and app integration.
